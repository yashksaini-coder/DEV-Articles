  🌟 Hey everyone! 🚀 Recently I was scrolling through Instagram and stumbled upon the concept of _Public Learning _and I was hooked! 🤩 

After searching and learning more about this method I figured it out. 

The term "_Public Learning_" actually have two meanings:-

**_Learning in Public_**:- This is a growing trend where people share their learning journeys with others. This involve things like creating blog posts about what you're studying, sharing code you're working on, or even live streaming your study sessions. The idea is that by making your learning public, you can benefit from others' feedback and experiences, and you can also help to motivate and inspire others who are learning the same things.

**_Public Learning for Educators_**:- This is a more specific concept used in professional development for teachers. It involves educators sharing their teaching practices and challenges with each other in a safe and supportive environment. This can help teachers to learn from each other's experiences, improve their teaching skills, and better understand the needs of their students.
