  Hello everyone! 👋 I am an aspiring Data Scientist from India 🇮🇳 currently developing my data science skills. Recently, I've been having some problems in understanding the importance of skills.

I am confused whether to learn DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) or Web Development. I believe that with data science these skills are also necessary to include in your codebase. But which one holds more importance, that is the main question that troubles me the most.

So, I came across this platform to look for professionals who have years of valuable experience. Please, if anyone can help me & guide me in the proper direction or clear my thoughts.

Thank you! 🙏💻
